        Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license
        agreement between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software
        installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
        and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a
        business, where your principal place of business is located, one of its
        affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is
        the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its
        affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you acquired the software
        directly from Microsoft. Note that if you are a volume license customer,
        use of this software is subject to your volume license agreement rather
        than this agreement.
